Abandon Ship
############

*A Ludum Dare Compo Entry for LD37, theme: One Room*

You wake up from stasis, the alarm is blaring.
The core is going to blow.
You need to escape.
Cryosleep has scrambled your brain, you can't remember anything of the layout of your ship.
You need to find the **one room** that matters, the escape pod room.
